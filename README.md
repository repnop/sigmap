# `sigmap`

Made this so I could Ctrl+C `mariadb` containers, no clue if it works well for
other stuff. Works on Linux, that's about it, might work on other *nixes, give a
whirl and don't tell me the results. Tried to keep input/output flowing well. I
wouldn't bother with PRs if you find an issue, probably not going to watch this
repo at all, just fork and edit it for yourself and `cargo install --path <path
to fork>`. Good luck and may Ferris have mercy on your soul if you actually need
this!
